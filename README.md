# Chat Application for Pentesting
This app is built to demonstrate that we can build malicious applications on Android Studio. Building apps using Metasploit 
are easily detected, therefore developing them using simple libraries and functions does the job surreptitiously.

This chat application can extract the following information from the victim:

  1. Call logs
  2. Contacts
  3. Messages
  4. Notifications

One can easily forward the logs from the application to a remote server.
